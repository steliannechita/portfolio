        <h4>
          Welcome to my web page! I am Stelian,{" "}
          <span>passionate self-taught web developer</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          My coding journey began in 2018 when I get to watch “Introduction to
          Computer Science” video, by edX, Harvard OpenCourseWare. Since I have
          always been an analytical mind and passionate about science and
          technology, this aroused my curiosity.
          <br />
          <br />
          After doing some research, I have decided to enroll Codecademy Online
          Learning Platform and started the Web Development path. Along the way,
          I became fascinated about it and started using multiple learning
          resources (Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, stackoverflow, GitHub, Scrimba,
          CodeWars ,LeetCode, YouTube, Udemy and a few more).
          <br />
          <br />
          Most of my spare time is currently dedicated to learning new
          technologies and sharpening my programming skills and knowledge.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am also a regular in a lot of web development events and initiatives
          (“Codecademy katathons meetups” during weekends, also “Time to React”
          and “React Team Training” coding events) for networking purposes and
          self-improvement.
          <br />
          <br />
          React JS is my favorite technology so far and I have built multiple
          functional projects with it. At the moment, I am working towards
          enhancing my React and JavaScript skills and I am looking forward to
          learn also React Native and Back-End technologies.
          <br />
          <br />I am a reliable person, punctual, positive, highly organized and
          efficient and I would love to transform my passion into a way of
          living, by joining a great web development team.
